# React Minesweeper
I made this project to practice React and TypeScript. 
Made it using the React + TS + SWC Vite template.
It's a simple minesweeper clone with a customizable board and some nice tile flip animations.

## Setup:
1) Install dependencies
    ```npm i```
2) Run app
    ```npm run dev```

## Tech Stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite/SWC
